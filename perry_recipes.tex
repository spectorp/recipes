\subsection{Buckwheat Pancakes}
Joy of Cooking\\
Makes about 18 4-inch pancakes. Note, a half recipe is almost too much for two people.\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
1 cup buckwheat flour\\
1 cup all-purpose flour\\
2 tablespoons sugar\\
1 teaspoon baking soda\\
1 teaspoon salt\\
2 cups buttermilk\\
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted\\
2 egg yolks\\
2 egg whites\\

{\bf Instructions}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Whisk dry ingredients together in large bowl.
\item Mix wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour wet ingredients over dry ingredients and combine with a few quick strokes of the whisk, leaving the batter slightly lumpy.
\item Whish the egg whites until stiff but not dry. This works well with an electric mixer. Fold into batter until just blended.
\end{enumerate}

Buttermilk substitute: for 1 cup buttermilk, add 1 tbs lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup measure and fill the rest with milk.


\pagebreak
\subsection{Popovers}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
1 cup flour\\
0.5 tsp salt\\
1 tsp sugar (optional)\\
2 tbs unsalted butter, melted\\
1 cup milk\\
3 large eggs\\

{\bf Instructions}\\
Makes about 8 popovers
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set out popover/muffin tins - silicone (set on a cookie sheet) are particularly good, don't require grease. Otherwise grease tins.
\item Make batter at least 2 hours before baking, or the night before, or up to two days in advance. Before using, bring to room temperature and stir again.
\item Place ingredients in a blender and zap. Scrape down sides and blend again. Can leave in blender until ready to bake.
\item Adjust oven rack to center-low position and heat to 375. If using metal or glass tins, place them (empty) in oven while heating.
\item Spray (metal or glass) tins and pan rim.
\item Fill each cup cup nearly full with batter and bake until popovers are light brown, 45-50 minutes, depending on size.  DO NOT OPEN OVEN DURING BAKING.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Variations}\\
Savory popovers: add 1/3 cup chopped chives, or some fresh thyme and 1/4 tsp pepper or some lemon zest. Add parsley and Parmesan. Add rosemary and pepper. Add 1/2 cup of grated cheese.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Banana Bread}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
1 1/3 cups flour (part wheat germ)\\
1 teaspoon baking soda\\
1/4 teaspoon baking powder\\
1/4 teaspoon salt\\
pinch nutmeg\\
6 tablespoons butter (3/4 stick)\\
1/2 cup sugar\\
1 teaspoon lemon juice\\
1 1/4 cups ripe banana, mashed\\
2 large eggs\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Grease 1 loaf pan pan, then flour lightly and set aside.  Mash bananas into a measuring cup to measure quantity.

\item Sift dry ingredients by measuring into the Cuisinart bowl and pulsing briefly.  Remove to a mixing bowl.

\item If including nuts, chop at this time in Cuisinart; set aside.

\item Cut butter into pieces and put into empty, Cuisinart bowl along with sugar and lemon juice.  Process well and scrape down sides.

\item Measure banana and add to butter. Blend.

\item Add eggs and blend. Scrape sides.  Heat oven to 350 and set rack in lower third.

\item Pour butter into flour and stir only until well mixed. (Add nuts and/or chocolate chips if desired.)  Pour into loaf pan and bake for 1 - 1.25 hr.  Test with a knife in the center to see if done.  Let sit 10 minutes in the pan, then remove to a cooking rack.

\end{enumerate}

VARIATIONS:\\
Add 1 cup walnuts, add nuts after banana and pulse briefly.\\

CHOCOLATE CHIPS:  For a dessert version, increase sugar to Â¾ cup and change nuts to pecans, and stir in 1 cup chocolate chips at the end.\\

BANANA COCONUT:  Add 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1 cup toasted, flaked coconut.\\

If banana is ripe before you are ready to cook, freeze the pulp, then defrost to use.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Crepes}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 large eggs\\
1 cup whole milk*\\
6 tablespoons water\\
1 cup flour\\
1/2 teaspoon salt\\
2 tablespoons canola (or part melted butter)\\

*If using low-fat milk, replace both whole milk and water with low-fat milk.\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Throw all the above ingredients in a blender (or food processor, or mix well by hand).  Transfer batter to a covered container and store in the refrigerator at least 1/2 hour and up to 48 hours.
\item Gently stir up batter, it should be slightly thicker than heavy cream.  Heat a 7-8 in crepe pan or small heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Brush the bottom with melted butter or vegetable oil.  When pan is hot, pour in 2 1/2 tablespoons batter, swirl pan to coat evenly.  Cook 30 seconds to 1 minute until mottled brown on the bottom, loosen the crepe and flip.  Cook another 30 seconds on the other side.  For a 9 - 10in skillet use 1/4 cup batter.
\item If not eaten right away, crepes can be double-wrapped in plastic and refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen up to 2 months.  To freeze, stack up 8 crepes, wrap in plastic wrap, then in foil, for several weeks.  To thaw, switch them from the freezer, directly to the refrigerator.  This will take about 3 hours.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Classic Pizza Dough}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
4-4.25 cups bread flour\\
2.25 tsp instant yeast\\
1.5 tsp salt\\
2 tbs EVOO\\
1.5 cups water, heated to 110 degrees\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pulse 4 cups flour, yeast, and salt in food processor until combined.  With food processor running, slowly add oil, then water; process until rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds.  Let dough rest 2 minutes, the process 30 seconds more.  (If, after 30 seconds dough is sticky and clings to blade, add remaining 0.25 cup flour 1 tbs at a time as needed.)
\item Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand until smooth, round ball.  Place dough in a large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled (1 to 1.5 hours).
\end{enumerate}


\pagebreak
\subsection{NY Times no-knead bread}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour, more for dusting\\
0.25 tsp instant yeast\\
1.25 tsp salt\\
Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt.  Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.
\item Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles.  Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.
\item Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
\item At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
\end{enumerate}

NOTE: Consider putting parchment paper at the bottom of the pot to prevent the bread from sticking. The dough should not stick if the pot is sufficiently hot.


\pagebreak
\subsection{NY Times no-knead wheat bread}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
2 2/3 cups bread flour\\
1 1/3 cups wheat flour\\
2 tsp salt\\
1/2 tsp yeast\\
2 cups water\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mix ingredients well in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap (tip: wetting the outside rim of the bowl will help the plastic wrap stick). Let rise for $\sim$12 hours.

\item Gently remove dough onto relatively heavily-floured surface, and fold dough 3 times. Try to minimize the amount you manipulate the dough. Place on a floured cloth and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise for $\sim$2 hours.

\item Preheat oven to 500-550 $^{\circ}$F, and place a dutch oven (with lid off but in oven) in the oven to also preheat. Once pre-heated, gently place dough in hot dutch oven, cover with lid, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove lid, and bake an additional 15 minutes. Unless eating immediately, allow sufficient time to cool before cutting.

\end{enumerate}


\pagebreak
\subsection{NY Times speedy no-knead bread}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 cups bread flour\\
1 packet (1/4 ounce; 2.25 tsp) instant yeast\\
1.5 tsp salt\\
Oil as needed\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Combine flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest about 4 hours at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

\item Lightly oil a work surface and place dough on it; fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes more.

\item At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6-to-8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under dough and put it into pot, seam side up. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.

\item Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
\end{enumerate}

NOTE: Consider putting parchment paper at the bottom of the pot to prevent the bread from sticking. The dough should not stick if the pot is sufficiently hot.

\subsection{Southern-Style Cornbread}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
4 teaspoons bacon drippings or 1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil\\
1 cup (5 ounces) stone-ground cornmeal\\
2 teaspoons granulated sugar\\
1 teaspoon baking powder\\
0.25 teaspoon baking soda\\
0.5 teaspoon salt\\
1/3 cup boiling water\\
0.75 cup buttermilk\\
1 large egg, lightly beaten\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat to 450 degrees.  Add bacon drippings to 8-inch cast-iron skillet and place skillet in preheating oven.

\item Place 1/3 cup cornmeal in medium bowl and set aside.  Mix remaining 2/3 cup cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in small bowl; set aside.
	
\item Pour boiling water over reserved 1/3 cup cornmeal and stir to make stiff mush.  Gradually whisk in buttermilk, breaking up lumps until smooth.  Whisk in egg.  When oven is up to temperature and skillet very hot, stir dry ingredients into mush mixture until just moistened.  Carefully remove skillet from oven.  Pour hot bacon fat from skillet into batter and stir to incorporate, then quickly pour batter into heated skillet.  Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and immediately turn cornbread onto wire rack; let cool for 5 minutes and serve.
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak
\subsection{Flying Biscuits}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 cups all-purpose flour\\
1 tbs plus 1.5 tsp baking powder\\
0.75 tsp salt\\
2 tbs plus 1.5 tsp sugar\\
6 tbs unsalted butter\\
2/3 cup heavy cream\\
2/3 cup half and half (plus 1 tbs for brushing the top of the biscuits)\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat oven to 350$^\circ$F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

\item Place flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into 1/2 tablespoon-sized-bits and add to the flour. Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in all the heavy cream and the half and half.

\item Stir the dry ingredients into the cream and mix with a wooden spoon until dough just begins to come together into a ball. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 2 or 3 times to form a cohesive mass. Do not overwork the dough.

\item Using a rolling pin, roll the dough to a .5 inch thickness.  Cut out biscuits using a ~2 inch circular thing.

\item Place the biscuits on the prepared sheet pan, leaving about 1/4 inch between them.

\item Brush the tops of the biscuits with 1 tablespoon of half and half.

\item Bake for 20 minutes. Biscuits will be barely browned on top and flaky in the center when done. (Donât overcook them â otherwise they get hard).
\end{enumerate}


\pagebreak
\subsection{Pita Bread}
Makes 8 pitas\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 cups flour\\
1 1/2 teaspoons salt\\
1 Tablespoon sugar or honey\\
1 packet yeast (or, if from bulk, 2 teaspoons yeast)\\
1 1/4 to 1.5 cups water, roughly at room temperature\\
2 tablespoons olive oil, vegetable oil, butter, or shortening\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mix yeast with flour, salt, and sugar.  Add olive oil and 1 1/4 cup water and stir.  All of the ingredients should form a ball. If some of the flour will not stick to the ball, add more water (I had to add an extra 1/4 cup). 

\item Knead dough approximately 10 minutes (or until your hands get tired). If you are using an electric mixer, mix it at low speed for 10 minutes.  Form dough into a ball and place it in lightly oiled bowl.  Cover bowl with plastic and let rise until doubled (~90 min).

\item When doubled, punch down divide it into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, cover with a damp kitchen towel, and let rest for 20 minutes.

\item While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and insert pizza stone. If you do not have a baking stone, turn a cookie sheet upside down and place it on the middle rack of the oven while you are preheating the oven.

\item Roll, stretch, and generally flatten dough on lightly floured surface. Should be between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick. If the dough does not stretch sufficiently you can cover it with the damp towel and let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before trying again.

\item They should be baked through and puffy after 3 minutes. If you want your pitas to be crispy and brown you can bake them for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, but it isn't necessary (in the batch pictured here I removed them at 3 minutes).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Lemony Carrot and Cauliflower Soup}
Melissa Clark, NYT Cooking\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
1 tablespoon coriander seeds\\
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for serving\\
1 large white onion, peeled and diced (2 cups)\\
2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped\\
5 medium carrots (1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (2 cups)\\
1.5 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed\\

\subsection{Roasted Tomato and White Bean Stew}
Colu Henry, NYT Cooking\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
1/2 cup roughly chopped Italian parsley leaves and tender stems\\
2 tsp lemon zest (from 1 large lemon) {\it Stew was good with 1 tsp}\\
20 oz cherry or grape tomatoes\\
1/4 cup olive oil, plus 2 tbs, and more for drizzling (optional)\\
1 tbs fresh thyme leaves\\
Kosher salt and black pepper\\
1 med. yellow onion, thinly sliced\\
3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced\\
1/2 tsp red-pepper flakes\\
2 15 oz cans white beans (such as butter or cannellini), rinsed\\
1.5 cups vegetable or chicken broth, or water\\
Flaky salt, for serving (optional)\\
Toasted bread, for serving\\

{\bf Instructions}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Heat oven to 425 F. In small bowl, toss parsley and lemon zest until combined. Set aside.
\item In large baking dish or sheet pan (consider silpat), toss tomatoes with 1/4 olive oil and thyme; season with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes until they have collapsed and begin to turn golden around the edges, 20-25 min.
\item While tomatoes roast, heat 2 tbs oil in large (12-inch), deep skillet or Dutch oven or medium. Add onion, garlic, and red-pepper flakes and cook until onion is softened and garlic is fragrant, 4-5 min. Stir in rinsed beans and broth and bring to simmer. With back of spoon or spatula, gently smash about 1/2 cup of the beans so they slightly thicken the broth. If you want a thicker stew, crush some more of the beans. Season with salt and pepper.
\item When tomatoes finish roasting, add them directly to the stew along with any juices. Simmer for 5-10 min more so the flavors become friendly; season to taste with salt.
\item Ladle into shallow bowls. Top each with lemon-parsley mix and drizzle with olive oil, and season with flaky salt, if you like. Serve with toasted bread.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Variations}

\item Add toasted bread crumbs on top. 
\item Top bowls with grated pecorino or Parmesan.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Minestrone}
From J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\\

This recipe is more of a blueprint for soup than a set of rules, allowing you to make a soup based on what you have on hand and your personal preferences.\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\

{\it For the beans (see note for canned)}\\
8 oz (225 g) dried cannellini, borlotti, or kidney beans\\
Kosher salt\\
1 medium onion, split in half\\
1 medium carrot\\
2 celery stalks\\
2 medium garlic cloves\\
1 large sprig rosemary\\
2-3 sprigs parsley\\
1 bay leaf\\

{\it For the soup base}\\
4 oz salt pork or pancetta, 0.25" dice (optional)\\
2 tbs EVOO, plus more as needed\\
1 medium onion, finely chopped\\
1 medium carrot, finely diced\\
2 celery stalks, finely diced\\
1 tbs rosemary\\
2 medium garlic cloves, minced\\
1 lb ripe Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped (use canned unless tomates are in season; see note)\\
1 Parmesan rind (optional, see note)\\

{\it To finish (see table below for other options)}\\
1 cup dried small pasta (e.g. ditili, macaroni, orecchiette)\\
1 medium zucchini, cut into bite-size pieces\\
1 medium summer squash, cut into bite-size pieces \\
4 ounces green beans, cut into 1/2-inch lengths\\
4 ounces spinach, roughly chopped (about 4 cups loosely packed leaves; 115g)\\
Chopped fresh herbs, such as basil, parsley, or rosemary, for serving\\
Freshly ground black pepper\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf For the beans:} In a medium bowl, cover beans with cold water by several inches and stir in 1 tablespoon salt. Let beans soak at least 12 hours and up to a day. Drain and rinse.
\item Combine beans, onion halves, carrot, celery, garlic cloves, rosemary, parsley, and bay leaf in a large pot and cover with water by several inches. Add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, topping up with water as necessary, until beans are fully tender, about 45 minutes. Using tongs, discard vegetables and aromatics. Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Transfer bean-cooking liquid to a 2-quart measuring cup and add enough cold water to equal 2 full quarts (8 cups; 2L).
\item {\bf For the soup base:} Heat pancetta (if using) and olive oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until pancetta has rendered fat and softened, but has not yet browned. (If omitting pancetta, heat oil just until shimmering.) Add onion, carrot, celery, and minced rosemary. Season with a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 10 to 15 minutes, adding more oil if pot appears dry or if vegetables are starting to stick to the bottom.
\item Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until most of their moisture has evaporated and the mixture starts to fry. (The sound should change from a sputtering simmering sound to a sharper crackle as vegetables start to fry.)
\item Add reserved bean-cooking liquid, beans, and Parmesan rind, if using. Let broth simmer for at least 10 minutes.
\item Add pasta (unless you are planning on simmering for a long time; see step 7), zucchini, squash, and green beans and simmer until pasta and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Discard Parmesan rind, if used.
\item Serve soup immediately as is, or continue simmering for up to 2 1/2 hours for a heartier texture and flavor (if simmering for a long time, add the pasta 10 to 15 minutes before serving). Alternatively, reserve half of soup on the side, continue to simmer the other half in the pot for up to 2 1/2 hours, and stir reserved soup back in for a soup that is hearty, but still has plenty of bright vegetable flavor and texture. Stir in chopped herbs and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Notes:}\\
Canned beans can be used in place of fresh. To use canned beans, in step 5, drain and rinse 2 cups of canned beans and add them to the soup, along with 2 quarts of homemade vegetable stock, or store-bought or homemade low-sodium chicken stock. Increase simmering time to 30 minutes before proceeding to step 6.\\

Use fresh tomatoes only if ripe and in season. Otherwise, tomatoes may be omitted or replaced with one (14-ounce) can of whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand or chopped with a knife. A Parmesan rind can be added to the soup while simmering for deeper flavor.\\

\subsection{Roasted Red Pepper Soup with Corn and Cilantro}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
5 large red peppers, washed, cut in half and de-seeded\\
4 large heirloom tomatoes, washed, cored and quartered\\
8 large garlic cloves, still in skins. \\ 
3 large shallots, peeled and halved\\
2 1/2 cups low sodium chicken stock, plus more if needed\\
1/4 teaspoon pimenton (smoked paprika)\\
1 small bunch fresh cilantro, well washed and spun dry\\
1 splash sherry vinegar\\
2 small ears sweet corn, cut from the cob\\
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, finely minced\\
1/2 shallot, finely minced\\
1 tablespoon butter\\
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese\\
EVOO\\
Kosher salt and black pepper to taste\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat oven to 425$^{\circ}$. Toss the pepper halves, tomato quarters, halved shallots and garlic cloves in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss with your hands to coat. Place them all in a single layer, skin side up in a large roasting pan.
\item Place the pan in the oven and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, until everything has started to take on a nice charred appearance. Check the shallots and garlic at this point, if they are nice and soft, remove from the pan and reserve, if not, you can keep them in the pan for the final 15 minutes of cooking.
\item At the one hour mark, remove the pan, peel the charred skin from the tomatoes and peppers, and squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins. Place the skinned tomatoes, peppers, garlic and shallots in a medium pot with the pimenton and chicken stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes.
\item Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender and place in a clean pan, check for seasoning and keep warm.
\item Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, toss in the cilantro and blanch for about 30 seconds. Pull from the pot with a slotted spoon and shock in ice water. When cooled, pour through a strainer to catch the cilantro, and pressing with the palm of your hand, wring as much of the water free as you can. Finely chop the herb, then toss into a bowl with enough EVOO to maker a spoonable cilantro oil, add a splash of sherry vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Reserve.
\item Preheat a skillet over a medium flame, and when hot add a splash of olive oil and the minced shallot. Cook until the shallot starts to take on some color, then add the corn kernels, some salt and pepper, and the fresh thyme. Cook for 2 minutes, toss in the butter, and when it melts, remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl.
\item To serve, place a small pile of the corn in the center of a warmed soup bowl, pour the soup around, drizzle with some cilantro oil, and finally, sprinkle with a little crumbled feta.

\subsection{Fish tacos}
From Rick Bayless\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
{\it Batter}\\
2 garlic cloves, peeled\\
Salt to taste\\
1/2 tsp Mexican oregano\\
1/2 tsp fresh black pepper\\
1 teaspoon yellow mustard (like French's)\\
1 teaspoon concentrated chicken base or chicken-flavor powdered bouillon\\
1 cup beer, sparkling water or water\\
1 tsp baking powder\\
1 cup all-purpose flour\\

{\it Other}\\
Vegetable oil to a depth of 1.5 inches for frying\\
1 pound boneless, skinless fish filets (practically anything will work, but I like larger-flake, lighter-flavor fish best for this preparationâthink catfish, halibut, sea bass, grouper and the like)\\
1/3 cup mayonnaise\\
1/3 cup sour cream or heavy (whipping) cream\\
1/4 cup milk\\
12 warm corn tortillas\\
1 cup (or more) thinly sliced cabbage\\
About 1 cup salsa (toasted arbol chile salsa, roasted green chile salsa, roasted tomatillo salsa or even one of the Mexican hot sauces like Tamazula or Valentina)\\
2 or 3 limes, cut into wedges\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Finely chop the garlic, sprinkle generously with salt, then mash back and forth with the side of your knife across your cutting board until crushed to a puree. Scrape into a medium bowl and add the oregano, black pepper, mustard, base or bouillon, beer or water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the flour and baking powder to the wet ingredients and whisk just until combined.

\item Heat the oil in a heavy skillet to 370 degrees. While the oil is heating, cut the fish into pieces about 3 inches long by 1/2 inch square. Use a pair of tongs to pick up a piece of fish, dip it completely into the batter, and lay it into the oil. Continue with a few more pieces of fish, filling the hot oil with an uncrowded layer. Fry, turning the pieces regularly, until deep golden and crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a low oven on a wire rack set over a sheet pan while you fry the rest of the fish.

\item Mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream and milk. Set out with the cabbage, salsa, warm corn tortillas, limes and the crispy fish for everyone to make tacos.

\subsection{Ultra-crisp-skinned pan-roasted fish fillets}
From {\it The Food Lab}\\
Note: This recipe will work with any skin-on firm-fleshed fish fillets, such as salmon, snapper, grouper, or bass. I prefer salmon rare to medium-rare; white-fleshed fish should be cooked at least to medium.\\

{\bf Serves 4}\\
4 skin-on fish fillets (about 6 ounces each)\\
Salt and freshly grounded black pepper\\
2 Tbs vegetable or canola oil\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove any bones with tweezers. Rinse fillets and press between paper towels to dry all surfaces thoroughly. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. If you have the time, seasoning it at least 45 minutes in advance and letting it rest in the fridge up to several hours can help the fish retain more moisture as it cooks. (If you don't have at least 45 minutes, it's best to season right before cooking, to prevent moisture drawn out by the salt from interfering with a crisp skin.)

\item Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the fish fillets skin side down, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, pressing gently on the back of the fillets with a flexible metal fish spatula to ensure good contact between skin and pan for the first minute. Then continue cooking until the skin has rendered its fa and is crisp, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift the fish with a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.
\item Flip the fish and cook on the second side until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120 degrees F for medium-rare (about 15 seconds), or 130 degrees F for medium (about 1 minute). Transfer the fish to a paper-towel-lined plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Miso-Glazed Fish}
Very good with black cod. Probably quite good with other fishies.\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
1/4 cup red or white miso paste\\
1/4 cup sake\\
2 tablespoons mirin\\
2 teaspoons soy sauce\\
1 tablespoon vegetable oil\\
1/4 cup sugar\\
4 black cod filets, 5 to 6 ounces each\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Whisk together miso, sake, mirin, soy sauce, oil, and sugar. Rub mixture over every surface of black filets. Transfer to a plastic zipper lock bag or sealable container. Proceed immediately to next step, or for best results, marinate for about 30 minutes or up to two days.
\item Adjust broiler rack to 4 inches from heat source and preheat broiler or toaster oven broiler to high. Cover a small broiler pan with aluminum foil. Place black cod filets skin side-down on pan. Broil until top surface is well charred and a thin skewer inserted into black cod shows no resistance at all when piercing through layers of flesh, about 10 minutes. If any areas of fish threaten to burn, shield with small pieces of aluminum foil.
\item When fish is cooked, carefully remove pin bones with a pair of tweezers (there should be no resistence), and serve immediately.

2 red onions, cut into 3 cm wedges\\
3.5 tbs olive oil\\
3.5 tbs light tahini paste\\
1.5 tbs lemon juice\\
2 tbs water\\
1 small clove garlic, crushed\\
3.5 tbs pine nuts
1 tbs za'atar
1 tbs coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley\\
salt and pepper\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat oven to 475 F.

\item Put squash and onion in a large mixing bowl, add 3 tbs of oil, 1 tsp salt, and some black pepper and toss well. Spread on baking sheet with skin facing down and roast in oven for 30-40 minutes, until the vegetables have taken on some color and are cooked through. Keep an eye on the onions as they might cook faster than the squash and need to be removed earlier. Remove from oven and let cool.
\item To make the sauce, place tahini in small bowl with lemon juice, water, garlic, and 0.25 tsp salt. Whisk until the sauce is the consistency of honey, adding more water or tahini if necessary.
\item Pour remaining 1.5 tsp oil into a small frying pan and place over medium-low heat. Add pine nuts along with 0.5 tsp salt and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the nuts are golden brown. Remove from the heat and transfer the nuts and oil to a small bowl to stop the cooking.
\item To serve, spread the vegetables out on a large serving platter and drizzle over the tahini. Sprinkle the pine nuts and their oil on top, followed by the za'atar and parsley.

\subsection{Pasta Puttanesca}
{\bf Ingredients}\\
1/2 pound pasta\\
1/2 cup olive oil\\
8 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced or finely chopped\\
8-12 anchovy fillets, finely chopped\\
2 large pinches red pepper flakes\\
1/2 cup capers, drained and chopped\\
1/2 cup pitted black olives, chopped\\
1 28 oz can whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano, roughly broken up by hand\\
Handful parsley, minced\\
2 oz grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan, plus more for serving\\
Salt and pepper\\
2 5 oz good quality oil-packed tuna cans (optional)\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Place pasta in a large skillet, sautÃ© pan, or saucepan and cover with water. Add a small pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent pasta from sticking.
\item Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, combine oil, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.) Add capers and olives and stir to combine.
\item Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. Continue to simmer until pasta is cooked to just under al dente (about 1 minute less than the package recommends).
\item Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce. Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander and add to sauce.
\item Cook until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in the water.) Stir in parsley and cheese.
\item Season with salt and pepper. (Be generous with the pepper and scant with the salt as the dish will be plenty salty from the other ingredients.) If using, stir in canned tuna and break it up with a fork. Serve immediately with more grated cheese at the table.

\subsection{Quick and easy ricotta gnocchi}
From: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
12 ounces best quality ricotta (about 1.5 cups)\\
1 ounces finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup, plus more for serving\\
4-6 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)\\
1 whole egg plus one yolk\\
Kosher salt and finely grated pepper\\
Semolina flour, for dusting (optional)\\
2 cups your favorite marinara sauce\\
EVOO\\
Minced herbs\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Line a large plate with three layers of paper towels or a clean dish towel. Transfer ricotta directly to paper towels and spread with a rubber spatula. Place another triple layer of paper towels or a clean dish towel on top and press down firmly with the palms of your hands to blot excess moisture. Peel off upper paper towels.
\item Place a large bowl on a scale and zero the scale. Scrape ricotta into bowl to weigh. Remove excess ricotta to leave exactly 8 ounces. Reserve excess ricotta for another use. Add Parmesan, 3 1/2 ounces of flour, whole egg, and egg yolk to bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Combine mixture with a rubber spatula. It should be sticky but not loose. Add flour a tablespoon at a time if it is still very moist after kneading with the spatula for 1 minute.
\item Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Flatten into a 4- to 6-inch disk and cut into quarters using a bench scraper. Working one piece at a time, roll dough into a log about 6 inches long, dusting with flour as necessary. Split log in half and roll each half into a log about 12 inches long and 3/4-inch wide. You should end up with 8 logs.
\item Using your bench scraper, cut each log into 8 to 10 gnocchi. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet dusted in semolina flour. Shake to lightly coat gnocchi and prevent sticking. At this point, gnocchi can be frozen. Transfer baking sheet to freezer until gnocchi are completely frozen, about 30 minutes. Transfer gnocchi to a zipper-lock freezer bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Cook directly from frozen, adding a few minutes to cooking time.
\item To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat sauce in a separate saucepan until hot but not simmering. Add gnocchi to pot, stir gently, and cook until gnocchi float for 30 seconds, about 3 minutes total. Drain gnocchi, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water. Add gnocchi and 1/4 cup of cooking water to pot with sauce and bring to a hard boil, stirring gently. Add more pasta water to thin sauce to desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
\item Stir in a big drizzle of olive oil and a handful of chopped fresh herbs. Transfer to a large serving plate. Sprinkle with more herbs and Parmesan cheese. Drizzle with more olive oil. Serve immediately.

\subsection{Pressure Cooker Coconut Curry Chicken}
From Melissa Clark

{\bf Ingredients}\\
3 to 4  ripe tomatoes, halved through their equators\\
3  tablespoons ghee, unsalted butter or safflower oil\\
3  tablespoons virgin coconut oil\\
2  cups finely chopped onions\\
6  garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced\\
2  tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger\\
1  teaspoon cumin seeds\\
1  3-inch cinnamon stick or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\\
8  cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat side of a knife, or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom\\
2  teaspoons ground coriander\\
1  tablespoon kosher salt\\
1  teaspoon ground turmeric\\
1/4  teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\\
1/4  teaspoon black pepper\\
2.5  pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks\\
1 to 2  teaspoons garam masala, to taste\\
1/2  cup canned unsweetened coconut milk\\
 Cooked basmati rice, for serving (optional)\\
 Plain yogurt, for serving (optional)\\
3  tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set a box grater over a bowl. Starting with their cut sides, grate the tomatoes through the large holes of the box grater so the tomato pulp falls into the bowl. Discard the skins. Measure out 2 cups of tomato purÃ©e.

\item Using the sautÃ© function, heat the ghee and the coconut oil in the pressure cooker. Stir in the onions and cook, stirring often to encourage even browning, until they are caramelized, 12 to 18 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger and cumin seeds; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon and cardamom and cook for another minute. Then stir in the coriander, salt, turmeric, red pepper flakes, black pepper and finally the tomato purÃ©e.

\item Add the chicken to the sauce, cover and cook on low pressure for 4 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally. If the sauce seems too thin, use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a bowl and then simmer the sauce on the sautÃ© setting until it has thickened to taste. (Note that the coconut milk will thin the sauce down further.) Stir in the garam masala and the coconut milk, and let the curry sit for 20 minutes for the flavors to meld. Serve with the rice and yogurt, if desired. Garnish with cilantro.

1  tablespoon kosher salt, more to taste\\
1  teaspoon ground black pepper\\
5  pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into two or three pieces\\

{\bf Sauce ingredients}\\
1  tablespoon peanut oil\\
4  garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane\\
2  tablespoons grated fresh ginger root\\
1/3  cup gochujang (Korean chile paste) or other chile paste or sauce such as Sriracha\\
1/4  cup soy sauce\\
2  tablespoons ketchup\\
2  tablespoons mirin\\
2  tablespoons honey\\
1  tablespoon rice wine vinegar\\
1  teaspoon Asian fish sauce\\
1  teaspoon sesame oil\\

{\bf SESAME PICKLED CUCUMBERS ingredients}\\
6  Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced (or about 4 cups sliced cucumbers)\\
1.5  tablespoons rice vinegar\\
2  teaspoons sesame oil\\
2  teaspoons brown sugar\\
1/2  teaspoon fine sea salt\\
1/4  cup thinly sliced red onion\\
2  teaspoons sesame seeds\\

{\bf For serving:}\\
Cooked rice or toasted slider rolls\\
Kimchi (optional)\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To prepare pork, combine garlic, brown sugar, chile flakes, salt and pepper. Rub marinade all over pork. If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to up to 24 hours. Otherwise, proceed with recipe.

\item Set electric pressure cooker to sautÃ© (or use a large skillet). Add pork in batches and sear until browned all over, about 2 minutes per side. Add 3/4 cup water to pot (or to skillet to deglaze, then move to pot), cover, and set to cook for 60 minutes on high pressure. Or cook in a slow cooker for 5 to 7 hours until tender.

\item While pork cooks, prepare sauce: In a small pot, warm peanut oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger, and sautÃ© until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set sauce aside. (It can be made up to 1 week ahead and stored in the refrigerator.)

\item Manually release steam. Let pork cool until you can handle it, then shred it into bite-size pieces. Pork can be made to this point up to 3 days ahead.

\item While pork cools, strain liquid from bottom of pot. Pour off fat (or chill liquid, then scoop off solidified fat with a spoon). Reserve.

\item Prepare cucumbers: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients except sesame seeds, and let sit, tossing one or twice, for at least 20 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds.

\item When ready to serve, heat broiler. Toss pork with sauce and 1 to 2 tablespoons cooking liquid â just enough so pork is evenly coated but not wet or runny. Spread mixture on a rimmed baking sheet, and broil until crisped on top, 2 to 3 minutes; it will char in places, and that's fine.

\item Serve pork over rice or on slider rolls, with cucumbers and kimchi, if desired.

3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\\
3/4 pound Italian sausage, casings removed\\
1 large onion, cut into 1-inch chunks\\
1 red pepper, cored and cut into 1-inch chunks\\
3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped\\
1.5 pounds plum tomatoes (1 28 oz can of tomatoes works well)\\
4 sprigs fresh thyme\\
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or basil.\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For the biscuits: In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry cutter or fork, cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Fold in the sour cream. Gently knead mixture until it comes together in a ball, adding a drop or two of milk if necessary. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
\item For the ratatouille: In a bowl, toss eggplant and zucchini with 5 tablespoons oil; season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread vegetables in a single layer on one or two large baking sheets (do not crowd vegetables). Transfer to oven and roast, tossing occasionally, until golden, about 20 minutes.
\item Meanwhile, in a large, deep, preferably oven-proof sautÃ© pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Crumble sausage into pan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to a paper towel-lined plate.
\item Return pan to medium heat and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Stir in the onion, pepper, garlic and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and thyme sprigs; simmer gently until tomatoes are cooked and mixture is stew-like, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sausage, roasted vegetables and parsley. If you are not using an oven-safe pan, transfer mixture to a 2-quart gratin dish or baking pan.
\item Divide biscuit dough into six equal balls. Use your palm to flatten each ball into a 1/2 -inch-thick disk. Arrange on top of ratatouille mixture. Brush biscuits lightly with milk.
\item Transfer skillet or pan to oven and cook until biscuits are golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
\end{enumerate}

Vegetarian variation: Replace sausage with sauteed or roasted mushrooms. Cook until they've lost around half of their moisture.\\

\subsection{Mocha Ice Cream}
Makes 1 quart. Really, really good.\\
For variations, refer to Melissa Clark recipe on NYT cooking.\\
Consider adding 1/2 cup sliced and caramelized almonds at end of churning (med-saucepan, med-heat, cook almonds with 2 tbs sugar and pinch salt until deeply golden, about 10 min).\\

{\bf Ingredients}\\
6 egg yolks, whisked \\
1 cup heavy cream\\
2 cups milk\\
2/3 cup sugar\\
1/8 tsp salt\\
1 tsp vanilla\\
1 cup chocolate chips\\
1/4 cup coffee grounds\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If using a manual ice-cream maker, chill interior vessel roughly a day in advance. 
\item Warm milk, cream, sugar, salt in saucepan over low-medium heat. Once warm, add chocolate, coffee, and vanilla.
\item Take roughly one third of the mixture and slowly add to egg yolks while whisking. The goal here is to prevent cooking the egg. Then, slowly incorporate back into saucepan while mixing. 
\item Heat gradually to 170 deg F, or until mixture coats the back of a spoon. Stir often to avoid curdling the egg. Then, take off heat and let sit for 20-30 minutes to let the coffee grounds fully steep.
\item Use fine sieve to strain out coffee grounds and any egg chunks.
\item Chill in fridge until it reaches ambient fridge temperature (typically at least several hours).
\item Add to ice-cream maker and churn for about 20 minutes until it reaches something like a soft-serve consistency. Freeze to allow ice-cream to fully set up.

\subsection{Charlie Bird's Farro Salad}

{\bf Ingredients}\\
2 cup farro\\
2 cup apple cider (not cider vinegar)\\
2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed\\
4 bay leaves\\
0.5-0.75 cup EVOO\\
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\\
140 grams Parmesan cheese, shaved with a vegetable peeler (1 cup)\\
140 grams chopped pistachio nuts (1 cup)\\
4 cups arugula leaves\\
2 cups parsley or basil leaves, torn\\
2 cups mint leaves\\
1.5 cup cherry tomatoes\\
2/3 cup thinly sliced radish\\
Maldon, or other flaky sea salt, as finishing\\

{\bf Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a medium saucepan, bring farro, apple cider, salt, bay leaves and 4 cups water to a simmer. Simmer until farro is tender and liquid evaporates, about 30 minutes. If all the liquid evaporates before the farro is done, add a little more water. Let farro cool, then discard bay leaves.
\item In a salad bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Add farro, cheese and pistachio nuts and mix well. This salad base will keep for up to 4 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator (bring to room temperature before serving). Just before serving, fold in arugula, herbs, tomatoes, radish and flaky salt to taste.

\item The lemon vinaigrette works really well, but could alternatively use a different acid.
\item Can substitute almonds for pistachios.
\item Obviously some vegetables and herbs can be substituted or added. Some possibilities include: celery, asparagus, good peas, currants, red and/or golden beets, etc.
\item Apparently there is a difference between pearled (bran removed; most common in the U.S.) and un-pearled or semi-pearled. If using the latter, the cooking time will probably need to be increased.

\section{Sous Vide}

\pagebreak
\subsection{Sous Vide notes}
{\bf Preparation}\\
Food should be fresh or defrosted before placing in the plastic bag. Prepare food with favorite aromatic herbs, like rosemary or thyme. Butter and marinades are not necessary because the food moisture is retained. For a poached effect, add broth or milk to the bag. For most meats and fish, salt and pepper is all that's needed. Salmonella is killed in 30 secs at 150 $^{\circ}$F and 15 mins at 130 $^{\circ}$F.\\

{\bf Cooking Times and Temperature}\\
(Aspen boiling temp 197.4 $^{\circ}$F and 11.2 psi)\\
Cooking times, starting at room or refrigerator temperature, depend on the doneness (medium rare) of the food and safety (never less than 130 $^{\circ}$F for more than 4 hours). Add 15 minutes for frozen food.

{\bf Finishing}\\
Once your food has been cooked sous vide, the final step is finishing. This is done by quickly searing in a hot pan with oil, using the oven broiler, using a torch, or a bbq. Most sous vide recipes include a finishing tip.\\

{\bf Quick chilling}\\
An advantages of sous vide is to cook a large batch of food (steaks, chicken breasts, salmon fillets, vegetables - whatever cooks at the same temperature) for later serving. Sous vide cooked food intended to be eaten later must be quick chilled from the cooking temperature to below 41 ${\circ}$F for storage in the refrigerator or freezer:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fully submerge the cooked food pouches in an ice water bath (half ice half cold water). 
\item Chill pouches for 30 minutes to 2 hours or more for roasts or large/thick pouches. 
\item Add ice as needed so that the water bath stays below 41 ${\circ}$F throughout the chilling process. 
\item When well-chilled, dry the pouches, label them with contents and date, and freeze or refrigerate for up to 48 hours. 
\end{enumerate}

Tip: Frozen ice packs may be used instead of ice cubes to chill the water.
